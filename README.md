I code in Lua using Love2D and Lovr. I make very basic games as of now, and mostly test stuff and learn lots. My favourite thing to see is red text in the output. Stack overflow is mid. Im a professional Discord mod and I love my job more than my family. All the games I make have public code so you can see and maybe learn from it! Im broke but have fun making games so it all balences out.
